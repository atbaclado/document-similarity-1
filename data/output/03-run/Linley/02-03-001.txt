score: 0.676570, para: 01 7 24	“String, string…” Linley hurriedly looked about for a thread on which he could hang the Coiling Dragon Ring. Suddenly, Linley’s gaze fell on a ruined old washcloth. His eyes lit up, and he immediately pulled a string out from within the washcloth.

Looking in that direction, they saw that to the north, a single brown haired boy was still holding firm. His lips tightened, the boy stared determinedly in front, both fists tightly clenched so hard that his fists were white.


score: 0.667466, para: 01 23 62	His ears twitched as he turned and stared towards a far-off building. “I heard something?” He immediately stealthily walked in that direction.
