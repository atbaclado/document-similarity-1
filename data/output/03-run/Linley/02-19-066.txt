source: 02 19 66	With the wave of an arm, Linley slammed Rand to the floor, as though he were nothing more than a beanbag.


score: 0.703695, para: 02 20 79	“Linley, thank you!” Rand said, bowing, causing Yale and others to be startled. And then, Rand stared at Linley and said resolutely, “But there will come a day when I will defeat you.”


score: 0.663935, para: 02 20 75	“Cough, cough.” Rand stood up, clutching his chest.


score: 0.644015, para: 02 20 69	Linley calmly glanced at Rand once. Linley was very clear about the attack he had just used. With just a month’s recovery time at most, Rand would be fine. If he, Linley, had decided to be merciless, he could have directed the stones at Rand’s head and most likely finished him.


score: 0.604652, para: 02 20 67	One stone smashed into Rand’s stomach, immediately causing him to vomit fresh blood. Rand hurriedly used his arms to cover his chest. Two more striking sounds were heard, and Rand was directly thrown off the dueling area, his entire body covered with dust.


score: 0.602080, para: 02 20 53	Immediately, many cheers exploded from below. During the yearly tournament, Rand had many supporters, while in contrast, very few people were supporting Linley.


score: 0.561937, para: 02 20 61	But Rand had released a spell at the same time, and five balls of dull red flame shot towards Linley as well. The blades of wind were much faster than the fireballs, however, and Rand was forced to dodge in a rather sorry fashion. But Linley casually and effectively sidestepped the fireballs. And, while doing so, Linley’s lips continued to move as he executed his second spell.


score: 0.554331, para: 02 20 77	“Yale, tomorrow, bring Linley. I’ll go with you to the Golden Bank of the Four Empires local branch to transfer money. Ten thousand golds. I’ll keep my word.” Rand took a long look at the distant Linley. This defeat at Linley’s hands had totally woken Rand up from the arrogant haze of being a genius.


score: 0.552463, para: 02 21 8	Yale’s arm was around Linley’s shoulders, and he whistled a little tune while delightedly peering at the nearby Rand and his bros.


score: 0.530630, para: 02 20 35	“Ten thousand gold?” Rand couldn’t help but feel his heart shake.
