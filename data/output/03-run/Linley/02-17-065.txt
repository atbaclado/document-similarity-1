score: 0.616491, para: 02 1 21	“It moved really fast, tens of meters in the blink of an eye. But since it is a Shadowmouse, I guess that isn’t out of the ordinary.” Linley still remembered its earlier movements clearly.


score: 0.613349, para: 02 18 36	Hearing these words, Linley couldn’t help but look up at Trey in surprise.


score: 0.562471, para: 02 3 31	The black Shadowmouse immediately moved and in the blink of an eye, appeared over ten meters away. His two guileless eyes stared towards the doorway, and he immediately saw Linley. His eyes were filled with caution.

score: 0.545202, para: 02 18 17	“Naturally, we wind magic practitioners will also do battle. Everyone interested in enrolling, please speak to me.” Instructor Trey smiled as he spoke, but his gaze drifted towards Linley.
