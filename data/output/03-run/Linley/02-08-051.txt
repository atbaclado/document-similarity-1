source: 02 8 51	Because he knew how powerful a dual-element magus was; far more powerful than a single-element magus.


score: 0.821988, para: 02 1 13	“And Shadowmice? How powerful is a Shadowmouse?” Linley asked.


score: 0.821988, para: 02 1 14	There was a Shadowmouse not too far from him. Naturally, Linley wanted to know more about how powerful they were.


score: 0.807082, para: 01 11 34	Linley suddenly had a powerful urge to become a powerful magus as well.


score: 0.724024, para: 01 13 32	Linley wanted a magical beast of his own as well, such as a powerful Velocidragon.


score: 0.597054, para: 01 14 20	“Actually, all of you knew how powerful the Velocidragon was from the moment you saw it. No need for me to elaborate.” Linley said with a smile.

Let’s look at forbidden-level magical spells. The mageforce in the body of a Saint-level magus can only provide 1% of the amount of essence needed. The other 99% can only be provided by natural, elemental essence.”


score: 0.545751, para: 02 5 19	Linley couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of veneration for Doehring Cowart from his heart. A Saint-level Grand Magus of the Pouant Empire, and one of the most powerful persons in the Yulan continent. And now, Doehring Cowart was carefully instructing himself in magic. How fortunate Linley was!


score: 0.541306, para: 02 15 16	Yale shook his head. “I’m not even a magus of the first rank yet. Based on my strength, maybe I could train a magical beast of the first or second rank, but what would I do with such a weak critter? And the infants of magical beasts of the seventh or eighth ranks are extremely hard to acquire. What’s more, the infants of those beasts are more powerful than me, even as babies.”
