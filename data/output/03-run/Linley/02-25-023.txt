Linley let out a comfortable burp, then used the napkin to wipe his lips. Standing, he said, “Father, Uncle Hiri, I’m done eating.

Hiri and that collapsing ceiling arrived next to Linley at almost the same time.

The bloody youth’s face was ashen white. His left arm was broken, with white bones sticking out, and chest covered with claw marks.

And then, in the blink of an eye, the black mouse appeared tens of meters away in a different direction, and began to nibble on a piece of blue tile. The black mouse’s fur appeared very soft.
