score: 0.627860, para: 02 25 25	Linley’s gaze was totally fixed upon the stone.

When he thought of this, Linley felt his blood begin to boil.

The first thing he saw was Linley, head covered with blood. The sight of the blood was so piercing to the eye that Hogg felt his head grow foggy, and his body swayed, almost falling down.
