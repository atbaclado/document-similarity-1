In the past, when I was in the army, every day I would train like crazy, while on the battlefield, I engage in bloody close combat.

The little Shadowmouse’s mind was filled with questions. In his eyes, this was the time when Linley should be going off to kill a wild hare. Why had he taken up a bag and headed off with someone else?
