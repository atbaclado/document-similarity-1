Doehring Cowart was smiling so widely that his white whiskers were leaning horizontal. “Linley, over these past nine days, the little Shadowmouse has lost all fear of you.

Will we ever meet again?” Linley stroked the little Shadowmouse’s fur, somewhat unwilling to part from it.

He was so happy that he immediately began to hop up and down while squeaking at Linley, while even hugging Linley’s leg with his own front arms.
