And in addition, you are a dual-element magus! A dual-element magus of the seventh rank would definitely be a major force in the Kingdom of Fenlai.

We aren’t able to produce such a vast sum, but even if we were, the current owner wouldn’t be willing to sell to us.”

score: 0.538495, para: 01 3 37	Hearing Linley’s words, Hogg felt a warm feeling in his heart. He couldn’t help but hold Linley against his bosom. “Linley, don’t feel bad.
