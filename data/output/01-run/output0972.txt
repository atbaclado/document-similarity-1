So are you saying that little guy there is a magical beast of the third or fourth rank?” Linley followed up with more questions.

First rank and second rank magi are considered junior magi. Third and fourth rank magi are considered mid-level magi. Fifth and sixth rank magi are considered senior magi. The three ranks above them; seventh, eighth and ninth? These are all terrifyingly powerful people. And of course, above the magi of the ninth rank are the Saint-level magi!”

But as to whether or not you can become a magus of the ninth rank, or even a Saint-level magus?

At that point in time, you’ll have no one else to blame.”

That’s the only way.” Linley secretly pondered all the possibilities, but he knew very well how difficult this would be.
